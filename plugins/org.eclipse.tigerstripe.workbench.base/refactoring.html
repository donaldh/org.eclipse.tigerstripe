<h1>Tigerstripe Refactoring Support</h1>

<p>Up until 0.4.6, Tigerstripe refactoring was partially relying on the JDT refactor and would often lead to model and/or diagram
corruption as a result of not treating refactoring as an atomic operation for the workspace.</p>
<p>This page presents the new design and mechanism for refactoring support in Tigerstripe</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>Refactoring means renaming or moving one or multiple artifacts within a workspace and making sure the changes are propagated to all
related elements, such as associations, methods arguments, diagrams, etc.</p>
<p>Because this operation can be very complex, it is important to have it performed in an operation that is almost atomic for 
the workspace, without risking to run into any threading, concurrency or race condition. So, refactor will use 1 single thread to 
perform model updates and diagram updates. Asynchronous diagram sync shall be turned off by the refactor infrastructure as the refactor
is initiated.</p>

<p>As a result, we propose to implement Tigerstripe Refactoring support in a 2 step operations:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Step 1 - 'prepare':</strong>This step will first lock the workspace, preventing concurrent changes, and gather a list of changes to perform 
		to complete the refactor.</li>
		<li><strong>Step 2 - 'refactor':</strong>This step will apply the list of changes while the workspace is locked, and diagram synchronization is off. 
		Diagram changes will part of the refactor and performed at this time rather than being a "catch-up" operation performed
		in a separate thread. Similarly, propagation to annotations will be performed at this time too.</li>
	</ul>
	The operation can be canceled until step 2 begins. Step 2 cannot be canceled and should only be launch once it is clear
	that the operation can be successfully completed (workspace locked, all resource up2date and saved, etc...).
</p>

<p>Tigerstripe refactor should provide 3 'entry points' for refactor:
	<ul>
		<li>at the 'IAbstractArtifact' level (as opposed to IModelComponent): Indeed, in a Tigerstripe model only artifacts are cross-referenced, so
as opposed to Java refactoring where renaming an attribute means potential changes to other files where this attribute may be
referenced, an attribute in a Tigerstripe cannot be referenced directly.</li>
		<li>at the diagram level: since renaming or moving a diagram requires changes on multiple files, it is important to that
		these changes applied in an atomic fashion.
		</li>
		<li>at the project level: renaming a project requires multiple synchronizations with annotations, cross-model references, etc.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Proposed API</h2>
<p>We use a singleton to funnel all Tigerstripe refactor operations. No concurrent refactor shall be allowed. Furthermore, as we
evolve Tigerstripe to use EMF natively, a write transaction for refactor should be used.</p>
<p>A refactor action will be passed to the Refactor API as one or more RefactorRequests. These requests will be processed by the Refactor
infrastructure to derive a set of IModelChangeRequests. The set of changes is then to be applied to the workspace to affect the model.</p>
<p>To compute the list of RefactorChanges - and following the JDT refactor principles - the refactoring infrastructure will pass
the RefactorRequest to all registered RefactorParticipants which may return refactor model changes.
<p>Each Refactor Model Change will lead to Diagram updates and Annotation Updates. They will be applied in the same thread at that time
rather than being delayed.</p>

<p>Note that the current implementation of IModelChangeRequest tries to perform some 'refactor logic' by trying to propagate
name changes etc... The refactor API will go with the assumption that every single change needs to be explicitly applied, so
that the IModelChangeRequest will need to be changed to do only the requested change, no propagation</p>

<p>The early proposed API is implemented (in progress) in the org.eclipse.tigerstripe.internal.refactor package. A basic model
refactor could look like this:</p>

<tt>
	// build the request
	ITigerstripeModelProject proj1 = ...
	ITigerstripeModelProject proj2 = ...
	ModelRefactorRequest req = new ModelRefactorRequest();
	req.setOriginal( proj1, "com.mycompany.Art1");
	req.setDestination( proj1, "com.mycompany.Art2");
	
	// get the corresponding command
	IRefactorCommand cmd = RefactorManager.INSTANCE.getRefactorCommand( req, monitor );
	
	// at this point the set of actions to be performed for the refactor
	// can be presented to the UI.
	
	// Execute the refactor
	cmd.execute(monitor); // workspace is locked.
	
	// refactor is done. 
</tt>

<p>This goes under the assumption that between the cmd was created and the time it is executed, no change
occurred that would make the cmd invalid. Maybe we need to ensure that?</p>

<h2>UI Refactor Actions</h2>
<p>All UI Refactor actions should be re-implemented to use the new refactor mechanisms. This is valid for Tigerstripe Explorer right-click
actions as well as artifact renames from artifacts.</p>
