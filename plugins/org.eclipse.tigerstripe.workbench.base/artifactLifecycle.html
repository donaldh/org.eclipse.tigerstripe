<h1>Artifacts Lifecycle</h1>
<p>As part of a the API-refactoring, the lifecycle of Artifacts has been revisited. The existing
API had evolved into a very complicated series of interactions between the Artifact Mgr and its
clients.</p>
<p>The lifecycle of Artifacts now takes into account the following requirements:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Decoupling with persistence layer</strong>: the API should make no assumption
	about the persistence mechanism used to persist Artifacts. In particular, nothing regarding
	the parsing/loading should be explicitly exposed thru the API</li>
	<li><strong>Working copy for Editing in Editor</strong>: requires the ability to get a working copy of
	an Artifact. Optionally, this working copy should be refreshed by changes to that artifact
	from other clients.</li>
	<li><strong>Listeners for changes on Artifacts</strong>: registering for changes.</li>
	<li><strong>Resource tracking</strong>: ie. if the underlying resource where the artifact
	is persisted, it should be reloaded and working copies should be notified.</li>
	
</ul>
