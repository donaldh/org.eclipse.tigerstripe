<h1>Artifacts Lifecycle</h1>
<p>As part of a the API-refactoring, the lifecycle of Artifacts has
been revisited. The existing API had evolved into a very complicated
series of interactions between the Artifact Mgr and its clients.</p>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The Artifact Mgr holds the reference value of an Artifact and
	is responsible for persisting them</li>
	<li>Changes to artifacts can only occur in 2 ways:
	<ol>
		<li>Getting a "working copy" of an artifact from the Art. Mgr.,
		applying changes to it, and "committing" the changes on the working
		copy by providing it back to the art mgr.</li>
		<li>Submitting an IArtifactChangeRequest to the Art. Mgr.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Each change will be made as atomic functions and automatically
	persisted</li>
	<li>The Art. Mgr. will use a defined persistence layer that is
	responsible to provide read/store mechanisms to the Art. Mgr.</li>
	<li>The Art. Mgr provides mechanisms to query models</li>
	<li>During a generation phase no changes on the model shall be
	permitted</li>
	<li>There is one Art. Mgr. per Tigerstripe project. It cannot be
	accessed directly but through a "session" through the project handle.</li>
	<li>Working copies of Artifacts need to optionally receive
	notifications that their original artifact has been modified in the
	Art. Mgr. Trying to commit a working copy that is "out-of-sync" should
	optionally raise an exception.</li>
</ul>
