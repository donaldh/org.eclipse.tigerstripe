This is a macro to nicely format a set of exceptions with 
suitable commas and a ; at the end of the last line

It start with the ") throws" so should only be used once for a given method

*###
#macro(exList $opt $u $d)
#set( $c = ") throws " )
#if ($opt)
	    $c javax.oss.OssUnsupportedOperationException
#set( $c = "," )
#end
#foreach ($e in $u)
        $c $ossjUtil.interfaceOf($e).FullyQualifiedName
#set( $c = "," )        
#end
#set ($s = $d.size())
#set ($p = 0)
#foreach ($e in $d)
#set ($p = $p + 1)
#if ($p == $s)
#set ($end = ";")
#else
#set ($end = "")
#end
        $c $e$end
#set( $c = "," )
#end
#end
## End of ExList
