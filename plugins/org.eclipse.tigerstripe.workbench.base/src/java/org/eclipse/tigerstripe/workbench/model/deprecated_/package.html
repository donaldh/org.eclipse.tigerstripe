<h1>Old Model Management and Metamodel API</h1>
<p>This package contains the Old metamodel API. This API is the
original API that is not built on top of EMF, but was built-up manually
overtime. As part of the refactoring and the alignment effort with other
existing Eclipse frameworks, this API should be considered obsolete, to
be replaced with a EMF-based implementation of this API.</p>

<p>The migration to a fully EMF-based API is expected to happen by
v1.0 of Tigerstripe Open-Source.</p>
