This package contains base interfaces to various components that are
used in constructing Tigerstripe Artifacts.

<h2>Artifact Management</h2>
<p>A Tigerstripe model is made of Artifacts (i.e. implementations of
the IAbstractArtifact interface). Models can be created, queried and
modified through the IModelManager interface.</p>

<p>The IModelManager provides a series of methods to ensure that no
assumption is made on the actual implementation of the model and on how
it is persisted and that the integrity of the model can be preserved in
a multi-threaded IDE.</p>
