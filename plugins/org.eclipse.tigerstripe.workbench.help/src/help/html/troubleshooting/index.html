<h1>Tigerstripe Troubleshooting </h1>
<p>Similarly to usual Eclipse projects, <b>Tigerstripe</b> Projects are constantly audited by the <a href="../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/projectauditor.htm">Tigerstripe Auditor</a>, which operates in the background and checks the model.</p>
<p>When errors or inconsistencies are found they are reported in the Problem View of Eclipse. Refer to <a href="projectAuditErrors.html">Project Audit Troubleshooting</a> for a detailed list of possible errors and their associated fixes. </p>
