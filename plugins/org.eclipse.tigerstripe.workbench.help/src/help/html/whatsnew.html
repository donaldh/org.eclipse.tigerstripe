<h1>What's new in Tigerstripe Workbench</h1>
<p><b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> uses a revolutionary approach based on <b>Service Artifacts</b> to model the information and behavior of a <b>Service Contract</b> deployed in a Service Oriented Architecture. <b>Service Artifacts</b> introduce additional patterns and constraints compared to a typical modeling environment (for example, UML2). These enable architects, service designers and developers to automatically create consistent <b>Service Contract</b> metadata that helps to ensure a successful deployment in a product suite or enterprise architecture.</p>
<p>This <b>Service Contract</b> metadata is used to feed an ultraflexible generation engine to derive <b>Service Contract</b> implementation, runtime libraries, deployment information, test harnesses and documentation. The generation can be further extended and tailored to specific environments by editing and creating additional <b>Tigerstripe</b> Plug-ins.</p>
<h2>Tigerstripe Workbench 2.2</h2>
<blockquote><p>The release of <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> versioin 2.2 includes the following:<p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="tasks/DiagramEditor/Instance/instance.html">UML Instance Diagrams</a> to graphically define an instance of your service contract at a given point of time.</li>
	<li>Custom Service Contract use case documentation, including diagram references.</li>
	<li>Optional Hibernate and Axis plug-ins allowing generation of Service Stubs for testing in a sandbox environment</li>
	<li>Linux support</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>Tigerstripe Workbench 2.1</h2>
<blockquote><p>The release of <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> version 2.1 includes the following:</p>
<ul> 
   <li><a href="tasks/facets/index.html"><b>Service Contract Facets</b></a> to define the scope within a service model and allowing you to define multiple facets of a <b>Service Contract</b> from a single service model.</li>
   <li>Improved UML Class Diagrams that includes (1) <i>package</i> visibility for attributes, methods, and association ends, (2) component visibility with usual UML notation on attributes, methods, and association ends and (3) <i>abstract</i> qualifiers are displayed properly in italic characters according to UML conventions for Artifact and Method names. For detailed information, refer to <a href="tasks/interfaceModelingTasks/infoModelingTasks/entityAttributes.html">Entity Attributes</a>.</li>
   <li>The ability to show or hide relationships in a Class Diagram.</li>
   <li>The ability to specify additional files referenced by a custom plug-in. These files are included in the plug-in and can be referenced from within templates, with the <i>$pluginDir</i> context entry.</li>
   <li>An enhancement has been introduced in Artifact-based rules to optionally loop over all artifacts visible in the context, i.e. including those defined in referenced projects or dependencies. This option is available from the <b>Artifact Based</b> rule definition editor.</li>
   <li>The velocity context has been extended with new entries corresponding to all artifacts visible in a project.  The following have been added <i>$allArtifacts, $allEntities, $allDatatypes, $allExceptions, $allQueries, $allUpdateProcedures, $allSessions, $allEnumerations, $allEvents, $allAssociations, $allAssociationClasses, $allDependencies</i>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>Tigerstripe Workbench 2.0</h2>
<blockquote><p>The release of <b> Tigerstripe Workbench</b> version 2.0 includes a large number of new features for flexibility and ease of use. Some of these new features include:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Graphical User Interface for Service Contract Design</li>
   <li>Fully customizable plugins based on Velocity Templates and Java code</li>
·  <li>UML2 support with additional UML2 elements such as <b>Associations</b>, <b>Association Classes</b>, or <b>Dependencies</b>, but also UML2 Import/Export.</li>
·  <li><b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> Java API, allowing you to write your own java code to interact with  <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b></li>
</ul></blockquote>
