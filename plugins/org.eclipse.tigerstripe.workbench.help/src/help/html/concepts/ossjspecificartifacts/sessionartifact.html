<h1>OSS/J Session Facade Artifact</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote><p>An OSS/J Session Facade Artifact models an integration point for a Service Contract. Through this facade, operations on Managed Entities are exposed, Queries and UpdateProcedure are accessible. Also, this is the logical source of emitted notifications. Defining Session Facades is typically the final step in assembling a Service Contract, where information model and the capabilities of the Service Contract are selected. </p></blockquote>
<h2>Modeling Details</h2>
<blockquote><h3>Standard Modeling Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Package:</strong> a valid package name. </li>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> a unique name for this Session Facade within the scope defined by the package.</li>
  <li><strong>Super-Artifact (optional):</strong> the fully qualified name of the Session Facade being extended by this Session Facade definition. This is optional. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Artifact Specific Modeling Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Session Facade Methods</strong>: Session Facade methods represent additional methods (ie. on top of all methods exposed as a result of Managed Entity operations, queries and update procedures) available for ad'hoc functionalities. </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>Generation Details</h2>
<blockquote><h3>Standard Generation Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interface Package</strong>: the name of the package where the corresponding Java Interfaces shall be generated. If a default interface package has been set for the project, this value will be used by default. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Artifact Specific Generation details</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Managed Entities:</strong> the list of Managed Entity Artifacts that are specifically managed through this session facade. By selecting these entities to be managed, one implicitly define the stewardship of this entities. Operations defined on the selected entities will be exposed through the facade.</li>
  <li><strong>Named Queries</strong>: the list of named queries that are offered through this Session Facade. The result of all these queries needs to be within the set of Managed Entities as managed by this facade.</li>
  <li><strong>Update Procedures</strong>: the list of Update Procedures offered through this Session Facade. </li>
  <li><strong>Emitted Notifications</strong>: the list of notifications that may be emitted through this facade (acting as the logical integration point).</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>Generated Elements </h2>
<blockquote><p>As a result of defining a Session Facade in a Tigerstripe Model, the following is generated:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>J2EE Integration Profile</strong>: the Java interfaces corresponding to a Session Bean for that facade. All methods on the facade will appear on the session bean. </li>
  <li><strong>JMS/XML Integration Profile</strong>: all messages (request, response and exception) required to implement all the methods of the session facade as well as access to queries and update procedures.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Service Integration Profile</strong>: a Web Service definition corresponding to the Session Facade. For every Session Facade definition, a WSDL file is created. </li>
</ul></blockquote>
