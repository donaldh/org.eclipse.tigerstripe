<h1>Generated Documentation</h1>
<p>To facilitate collaboration between teams and place <b>Service Contracts</b> as a true interaction point, <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> can generate a web-based document of your <b>Service Contract</b>, also providing a placeholder for the generated technology specific integration profiles.</p>

<h2>Publishing a Service Contract</h2>
<blockquote><p>Once the design of your <b>Service Contract</b> is complete and teams begin to build the implementation of the <b>Service Contract</b> and Business Process Managers start consuming the <b>Service Contract</b>, it is important to provide a single source of information for your <b>Service Contract</b>. To facilitate this, <b>Tigerstripe</b> provides the option to <em>publish</em> a <b>Service Contract</b> to a web-site.</p>
<p>The result of a <em>publish</em> operation is a self-contained web site that can either be browsed locally directly from a desktop or from a fully featured hosted web-site. The content of the published information is intended for Architects and Engineers that will either implement the <b>Service Contract</b> or consume its capabilities. The published web-site does not require access to <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b>; it is fully accessible through your web-browser.</p>
<p>The generated web-site contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation on all artifacts present in the model. The description provided during the model design phase is captured and displayed.</li>
  <li>Documentation about the <b>Tigerstripe</b> model itself, such as version information, build information, and potential dependencies.</li>
  <li>Direct links to zipped version of the generated integration profiles, providing a convenient access point for others to download the produced specifications.</li>
</ul>
