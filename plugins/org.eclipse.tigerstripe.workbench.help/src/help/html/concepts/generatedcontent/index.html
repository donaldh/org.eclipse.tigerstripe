<h1>Generated Elements</h1>
<p>Being a Model-Driven-Design environment, the purpose of Tigerstripe Workbench is eventually to produce a Service Contract specification, fully specified and fully documented, ready for implementation and deployment.</p>
<p>To that end, Tigerstripe generates a number of different kind of elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="generatedspecifications.html">A series of technology specific Service Contract specifications</a>. Based on a Service Contract model, a J2EE integration profile, an XML integration profile and a Web Service integration profile are generated. These are sometimes referred to as "bult-in" plugins.</li>
  <li><a href="userDefinedGeneration.html">Outputs based on user defined plugins</a>. Users can write their own plugins, or use plugins developed by other users, to generate outputs according to their own standards, based on the Tigerstripe model.</li>
  
  <li><a href="generateddocumentation.html">A self-contained, web-based documentation of the Service Contract</a>. In order to facilitate teams interactions and truly use Service Contracts as integration points, Tigerstripe Workbench generates a browsable documentation that can be hosted on a web server or read locally from a hard drive.</li>
  
</ul>
<p>The control over what is generated, how much can be customized is detailed in <a href="../../tasks/generationTasks/index.html">this section</a>. </p>
