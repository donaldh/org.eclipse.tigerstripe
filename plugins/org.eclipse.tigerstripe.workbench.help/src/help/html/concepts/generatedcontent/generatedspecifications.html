<h1>Generated Specifications</h1>
<p>A run a of the Tigerstripe on a model can be configured to produce a set of technology specific integration profiles that provide a concrete, implementable specification of the target Service Contract.</p>
<h2>Technology Specific Integration Profiles</h2>
<blockquote><p>Based on a model, Tigerstripe can generate up to three concrete integration profiles, semantically equivalent, targeting the following three technologies: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>J2EE Integration Profile</strong>: this integration profile is intended for tightly coupled integration in a J2EE environment. The Service Contract model is transformed into a set of Java interfaces relying on the use of Session Beans to implement the main integration point. </li>
  <li><strong>XML Integration Profile</strong>: this integration profile is intended for loosely coupled integration in a Message-Oriented Middleware. The Service Contract model is transformed into a series of XML message definition that follow the semantics of the given model.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Service Integration Profile</strong>: this integration profile is intended for a true Web-Service based Service Oriented Architecture paradigm. The Service Contract model is transformed into a series of Web Services and associated xml Schema definitions, fitting the SOA paradigm.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>Customization</h2>
<blockquote><p>For each available profile, the output can be customized. For example, specific copyright notices can be added in the header of the generated files, XML schema naming conventions can be controlled from the GUI, etc..</p>
<p>For more details about customization of the generated elements please refer to <a href="../../tasks/customizationTasks/index.html">this section</a>. </p></blockquote>
