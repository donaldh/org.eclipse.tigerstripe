<h1>User Defined Generation</h1>
<p>In addition to the "built-in" plugins described <a href="generatedspecifications.html">here</a>, a run a of Tigerstripe on a model can be configured to produce a set outputs based on their own or their company's specific standards. This can allow for company specific interface format, but can also allow for documentation, implementation artifacts and other information to be created from the same model, thus ensuring consistency.</p>
<h2>User Defined Plugins</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>User defined plugins comprise a set of <b>rules</b> that define how model artifact and attributes are "rendered" in the output, what files are created etc, and a set of "Properties" that can be used to control the behaviour of the plugin. See the section <a href="../../tasks/pluginDesignTasks/index.html">Plugin Design Tasks</a> for more information on how to create a plugin.</p>
