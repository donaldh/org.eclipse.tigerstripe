<h1>Tigerstripe Projects </h1>
<p>Eclipse is centered around a workspace that contains projects. Each project is a container for resources (For example, files, source code, and directories) that are contextualy linked. <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> follows the same principle and introduces a specific type of Eclipse project; that is, <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b>. <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> contain the specifics of a <b>Tigerstripe</b> Service Contract Model. As a result, <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b> contain <b>Service Contract</b> model components (such as artifacts), documentation, and other files or directories that are relevant (and needs to be stored) within the context of a project.</p>
<p>This section discusses the details about the structure and content of <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b>. For more details about operations on <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b>, refer to <a href="../../tasks/interfaceModelingTasks/newTigerstripeProject.html">Creating a New Tigerstripe Project</a>.</p>
<h2>Tigerstripe Project Structure</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Tigerstripe Projects</b> are organized around the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="projectdescriptor.html"><b>Project Descriptor</b></a>: Stored as a self-contained XML file (<i>tigerstripe.xml</i>), this file needs to be in the top-level directory of your <b>Tigerstripe Project</b>. It contains details and documentation about your <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> and it is a mandatory piect of your <b>Tigerstripe Project</b>.</li>
  <li><a href="sourceartifacts.html"><b>Source Model</b></a>: The source model contains all source <a href="../tigerstripeartifacts/index.html">Artifacts</a> for your <b>Tigerstripe Service Contract</b> model. Artifacts are organized in packages and define your information models and service capabilities.</li>
  <li><a href="projectdependencies.html"><b>Project Dependencies</b></a>: The project dependencies are references to other <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> components. A set of projects can define dependencies to a common project where each of your <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b> can reference the model defined in the common project.</li>
  <li><b>Target Directory</b>: This is where all your generated files, either code or documentation, are located.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components constitute the source model of a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> and they allow the <b>Tigerstripe</b> Engine to generate your target <b>Service Contracts</b>. Consequently, these components are the only components intendend to be placed under version control. For more details on how to control versioning of your <b>Tigerstripe Project</b>, refer to <a href="../../tasks/teamCollaborationTasks/scm.html">Source Control Integration</a>.</p>
<p>The following image is an example of the <b>Tigerstripe Explorer</b> with the above components displayed:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../gettingstarted/basictutorial/firstproject/images/explorerWithTarget.gif"></p>
<p>Tigerstripe projects are proper Eclipse projects. As such they contain hidden files that Eclipse relies on. These files are created automatically by Eclipse and Tigerstripe when a new Tigerstripe project is created through the corresponding wizard. Without these Tigerstripe and/or Eclipse cannot function properly. In other words, creating a directory with a <em>tigerstripe.xml</em> file at its root is not sufficient to make a valid Tigerstripe Project. </p></blockquote>
<h2>Tigerstripe Project Status</h2>
<blockquote><p>When you open a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b>, that project is continuously audited in the <a href="../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/projectauditor.htm">Project Auditor</a>. The <b>Project Auditor</b> monitors your project for inconsistencies and errors and notifies you of any problems during the design. The result is a list of <i>Errors, Warnings</i> and <i>Information Messages</i> related to your project.</p>
<p>Your project status is determined by the message severity of the message displayed in the list of messages by the <b>Project Auditor</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Your project status will continue to be in &quot;Error&quot;, error messages will continue to displayed by the <b>Project Auditor</b>, and the generation of the corresponding <i>Service Contract</i> may be inconsistent or incorrect until you correct said errors.</p>
<p>Each of the error messages are attached to specific resources in your project (For example, <b>Artifacts</b> or <b>Descriptor</b>) and are represented in the <a href="../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/tigerstripeexplorer.html">Tigerstripe Explorer</a>. For each of the errors, an explanation is provided in the <b>Problems View</b> in the <a href="../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/index.html">Tigerstripe Perspective</a>. For more details possible error messages, please refer to <a href="../../troubleshooting/projectAuditErrors.html">Project Audit Troubleshooting</a>.</p></blockquote>
