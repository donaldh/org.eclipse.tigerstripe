<h1>Tigerstripe Project Dependencies</h1>
<p>Because <b>Service Contracts</b> are meant to interact within a complete SOA Solution, very often they will share common information models. To avoid duplication and increased complexity, such commonalities between <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects can be saved into a <b>Tigerstripe Module</b>. The module can further be referenced by other projects. These referenced <b>Tigerstripe Modules</b> are called <b>Project Dependencies</b>.</p>
<h2>Project Dependencies</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Project Dependencies</b> are a list of referenced <b>Tigerstripe Modules</b> required for a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b>. These dependencies typically contain common information models, for example a common definition of a <i>Customer Entity</i>, so that all <b>Service Contracts</b> of an end-to-end solution are based on common definitions.</p>
<p>Dependencies can be added to and removed from the list of dependencies of a project through the <b>Dependencies Tab</b> of the <b>Tigerstripe Descriptor Editor</b> as show below:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"><img src="../../images/dependencyTab.gif"></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If a project dependency cannot be satisfied (for example a missing file), the project will likely not be valid.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Tigerstripe Modules</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Project Dependencies</b> are references to a set of <b>Tigerstripe Modules</b>, for example, pre-packaged, binary-like, versions of <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects. Refer to <a href="../../tasks/importExportTasks/index.html">Import/Export Tasks</a> for more details on how to export an existing <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> into a module that can be referenced as a dependency by other projects. </p>
<p>Although <b>Tigerstripe</b> modules have a <em>.jar</em> file extension, they contain additional <b>Tigerstripe</b> specific information to further identify the content of a module. This additional information is displayed when selecting a referenced dependency in a <b>Tigerstripe</b> project descriptor (as show in the above image):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Module ID</strong>: a unique module identifier set when the module was created through a project export operation.</li>
  <li><strong> Builder Version</strong>: the version of Tigerstripe that was used to create this module. This is used to ensure compatibility between Tigerstripe versions.</li>
  <li><strong>Packaged Date</strong>: the date at which the module was created through an export operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Name</strong>: the project name as it appeared in the Tigerstripe project that was exported into this module at the time of the export operation. </li>
  <li><strong>Version</strong>: the project version exported into the module at the time of the export operation.</li>
  <li><strong> Description</strong>: the project description exported into this module at the time of the export operation.</li>
</ul>
