<title>Tigerstripe Project Dependencies</title>
</head >
<h1>Tigerstripe Project Dependencies</h1>
<p>Tigersripe models, very often share common base models. To avoid duplication and increased complexity, such commonalities between <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects can be saved into a <b>Tigerstripe Module</b>. The module can further be referenced by other projects.</p>
<p>Dependencies can be added to and removed from the list of dependencies of a project through the <b>Dependencies Tab</b> of the <b>Tigerstripe Descriptor Editor</b> as show below:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"><img src="../../images/dependencyTab.gif"></p>

<h2>Project Dependencies</h2>
<blockquote><p> There are two types of <b>Project Dependencies</b> in Tigerstripe. 
<br><b>Dependencies</b>, which are made by reference to <b>Tigerstripe modules</b> are mostly obsolete.
<br><b>Referenced Tigerstripe Projects</b> is now the preferred manner of managing project dependencies. A reference can be between projects within your workspace, or to <b>Installed Modules</b>. These references are made by <b>Model Id</b>. 
<ul>
	<li>If there is a Tigerstripe project in your workspace that matches the modelId specified, then that project will be used when resolving and generating artifacts. </li>
	<li>If there is no project in the workspace, then Tigerstripe looks for an <b>Installed Module</b> with that ModelId.</li>
	<li>If no <b>Installed Module</b> is found, then the reference is unsatisfied, and the model will be in error.</li>
</ul>
It is because of this override behaviour that this is the preferred method of referencing projects.

<h2>Installed Modules</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Installed Modules</b>, are pre-packaged versions of <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects that are wrapped up inside eclipse plugins and are part of the installed product. Refer to <a href="../../tasks/importExportTasks/index.html">Import/Export Tasks</a> for more details on how to export an existing <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> as an <b>Installable Module</b>.

<h2>Tigerstripe Modules</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Tigerstripe Modules</b>, are pre-packaged, binary-like, versions of <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects. Refer to <a href="../../tasks/importExportTasks/index.html">Import/Export Tasks</a> for more details on how to export an existing <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> into a module that can be referenced as a dependency by other projects. </p>
<p>Although <b>Tigerstripe</b> modules have a <em>.jar</em> file extension, they contain additional <b>Tigerstripe</b> specific information to further identify the content of a module. This additional information is displayed when selecting a referenced dependency in a <b>Tigerstripe</b> project descriptor (as show in the above image):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Module ID</strong>: a unique module identifier set when the module was created through a project export operation.</li>
  <li><strong> Builder Version</strong>: the version of Tigerstripe that was used to create this module. This is used to ensure compatibility between Tigerstripe versions.</li>
  <li><strong>Packaged Date</strong>: the date at which the module was created through an export operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Name</strong>: the project name as it appeared in the Tigerstripe project that was exported into this module at the time of the export operation. </li>
  <li><strong>Version</strong>: the project version exported into the module at the time of the export operation.</li>
  <li><strong> Description</strong>: the project description exported into this module at the time of the export operation.</li>
</ul>
