<h1>Deploy and Test Plug-in</h1>

<p>During plug-in development, you will need to test that your plug-in is delivering the desired results before sharing your plug-in with other users. Complete the following procedure to deploy your plug-in:</p>
<h3>To deploy your plug-in</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Click the <b>Overview</b> tab in your <b>Plug-in Project Descriptor</b>.</li>
   <li>Click <b>Package and Deploy this generator</b> in the <b>Testing</b> area of the descriptor. This will assemble all of the parts of your plug-in and bundle them for deployment in the current workspace.</li>
   <li>Select a <b>Tigerstripe</b> project and double-click <b>tigerstripe.xml</b> to open the project descriptor</li>
   <li>Select the <b>Generation</b> tab and a new section for deploying a plug-in displays.</li>
   <li>Open the plug-in and click <b>Enable</b> to enable the plug-in. Enabling the plug-in also enables all of the other controls for that plug-in.</li>
<p><b>Note:</b> It is possible to override the default values for the <b>Global</b> properties of the plug-in</p>
   <li>Click <b>Save</b> to save the <b>Tigerstripe</b> project.</li>
   <li>Ensure that the project is in scope and click <b>Generate new Tigerstripe Interface</b>.</li>
   <li>Review the generated code</li>
</ol>

<blockquote><p>Once deployed, your plug-in can be used by any <b>Tigerstripe</b> project in the workspace. References to your plug-in from a project are made using the identity <i>name(version)</i>, where <i>name</i> and <i>version</i> are the values set in the <b>Overview</b> tab for the <b>Plug-in Project</b>.
<p>Complete the following procedure to un-deploy your plug-in</p></blockquote>
<h3>To un-deploy your plug-in</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Click <b>Un-deploy this generator</b> in the <b>Testing</b> area of the plug-in descriptor.
   <p>-OR-</p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Tigerstripe</b> menu and select <b>Generators</b>.</li>
   <li>Highlight the plug-in you want to un-deploy, right-click, and select <b>Undeploy</b> from the shortcut menu.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Your plug-in will disappear from the list of plug-ins in the <b>Generation</b> tab of all <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects. It is not necessary to un-deploy a plug-in before re-deploying it, however the plug-in ID uses the <i>version</i> number when deploying. If the plug-in is updated before you re-deploy it, you must disable the old plug-in version before you can re-deploy the updated plug-in.</p></blockquote>
