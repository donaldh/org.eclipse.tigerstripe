<title>Generator Log Settings</title>

<h1>Generator log</h1>

<p>When creating complex, it is often useful to have the generator generate a specific log file during generation. 
This not only helps for debugging purpose but also helps when supporting the generator.</p> 

<h3>Setting up the logfile</h3>
<p>A log can be created by Generator. It is a <i>rolling log</i> meaning that a new log with a new numbered extension will be create
each time the generator is run. The name of the logfile is set by the generator developper, together with a default level of
logging.</p>
<p>This settings are available from the <b>Runtime</b> tab of the generator descriptor, as shown below:</p>
<p class="style1"><img src="../../images/pluginLogSetting.gif" ><br></p>

<h3>Logging to the logfile</h3>
<p>Once the logfile has been set up. Messages can be sent to the log from either the Java code of the generator or from Velocity templates using the following syntax:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>From Java</b>: PluginLog.logError(String msg, Throwable e) can be used throughout the generator code.</li>
	<li><b>From Velocity</b>: $pluginLog.logError("my message").</li>
</ol>
<p>Multiple log levels are available: Error, Warning, Info, Debug, Trace. Each of these levels can be accessed through a variation on the 'logXXX' method described above.</p>
<h3>Controlling the log during generation</h3>
<p>Users of the generator (i.e. once the generator has been deployed) can control the level of logging for a specific generator. The developer of a generator
can control the default level (see setting above), but the user can increase/decrease that as a property on the generator. See generator properties in the tigerstripe.xml project generation details.</p>
