<h1>Tigerstripe Profile Perspectives</h1>
<P>The <b>Tigerstripe Profile Perspective</b> has the same look and feel as the <b>Tigerstripe Workbench Project Perspective</b>. For detailed information about <b>Tigerstripe Workbench Project Perspectives</b>, refer to <A href="../../gettingstarted/basictutorial/firstproject/addingdescriptors.html">Documenting your Project</A>.</P>
<P><IMG src="images/ProfilePerspective.gif"></P>
<P>For this example, name your <STRONG>Tigerstripe Profile </STRONG>(<EM>simpleProfile</EM>), enter the version information (1.0), and a short description. </P>
<P>A <STRONG>Tigerstripe Project Profile</STRONG> contains multiple sources of information that display on individual tabs including:</P>
<UL>
   <LI>The <STRONG>General</STRONG> tab which allows you to control the OSS/J Legacy settings. This is where you can disable the OSS/J Legacy plug-ins available with <STRONG>Tigerstripe Workbench</STRONG>. For more information, refer to <A href="general_tab.html">The General Tab</A>.</LI>
   <LI>The <STRONG>Annotation</STRONG> tab which allows you to include additional information with your <STRONG>Tigerstripe</STRONG> model. Project annotations are useful for triggering different behaviors at project generation. For more information, refer to <A  href="createAnnotations.html">The Annotation Tab</A>.</LI>
   <LI>The <STRONG>Primitive-Type</STRONG> tab which allows you to include additional primitive types with your project.&nbsp; <STRONG>Tigerstripe Worbench</STRONG> is delivered with default primitive types. The project specific primitive types you define become available after you deploy your project. For more information, refer to <A  href="createPrimitiveTypes.html">The Primitive-Type Tab</A>.</LI>
   <LI>The <STRONG>Artifacts</STRONG> tab which allows you to control the artifacts available with the <STRONG>Tigerstripe Artifacts</STRONG> palatte. For example, if you know that users of the model will not be utilizing queries, you can disable the query artifact from the <STRONG>Tigerstripe</STRONG> palatte. These changes will become active after you deploy your project. For more information, refer to <A  href="selectArtifacts.html">The Artifacts Tab</A>.</LI>
   <LI>The <STRONG>Source</STRONG> tab which allows you to view the source file for your <STRONG>Tigerstripe</STRONG> <STRONG>Project Profile</STRONG>. This tab is standard with all <STRONG>Worbench Perspectives</STRONG>.</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> It is best to <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> modify the <STRONG>Source</STRONG> file for your <STRONG>Tigerstripe Project Profile</STRONG>. This tab should be used with extreme caution and under the support of the <STRONG>Tigerstripe</STRONG> team.</P>
