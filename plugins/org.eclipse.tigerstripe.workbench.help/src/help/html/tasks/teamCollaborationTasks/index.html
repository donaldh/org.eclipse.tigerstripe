<h1>Team Collaboration with Tigerstripe</h1>
<p>Being part of a larger Service Oriented Architecture design, Service Contracts are usually developed by teams. Tigerstripe Workbench acknowledges that by providing mechanisms to enable collaboration during the Service Contract lifecycle.</p>
<p>More specifically, Tigerstripe Workbench provides support for the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="buildAutomation.html">Automated build environments</a>: Tigerstripe workbench provides a <em>Command-Line-Interface</em> and an <em>Apache Ant</em> <em>task</em> for Tigerstripe, so Tigerstripe can be included within larger automated build environments.</li>
  <li><a href="scm.html">Source Control Management integration</a>: so that multiple architects can work on a single Service Contract design at the same time, Tigerstripe is integrated with source control management systems. An example of use with CVS is provided.</li>
  <li><a href="publishInterfaces.html">Release of Tigerstripe model as a web site</a>: to facilitate documentation and access to Service Contract designs, Tigerstripe provides a mechanism to publish a Service Contract model and associated generated integration profiles onto a web site. Through this web site, other users can browse the documentation of a Service Contract without requiring access to Tigerstripe Workbench. </li>
</ul>
