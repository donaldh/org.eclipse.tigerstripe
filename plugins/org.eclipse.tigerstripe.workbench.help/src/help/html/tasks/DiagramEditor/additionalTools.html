<h1>Additional Class Diagram Editor Tools</h1>
<h2>Context Menus</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In this section, we will discuss some of the other tools available with the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b>. These tools are not necessarily <b>Tigerstripe</b> specific. The <b>Class Diagram Editor</b> has been built on the <i>Eclipse</i> framework called the <b>Graphical Modeling Framework</b> (GMF). Use of this framework means that the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b> has many additional tools available that are provided by the GMF.</p>
<p>The following <a href="#Figure 1">figure</a>, shows one of the <b>Context Menus</b> provided as a part of the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b>.  You can access this particular menu by right-clicking anywhere on the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b>. To be more specific, anyplace on the diagram where there are no <b>Artifacts</b> or <b>Relationships</b>.</p>

<p>In the diagram <b>Context Menu</b>, you can see that there are a number of tools available. In this particular <a href="#Figure 1"></a>figure, the <b>Add</b> menu is displayed.  This <b>Add</b> menu allows you to add a number of different types of <b>Shapes</b> to your diagram. Once created, you can format these <b>Shapes</b> by right-clicking, and displaying the <b>Context Menu</b> appropriate for that <b>Shape</b>. Items in the <b>Shapes</b> Context Menu allow you to change the background and foreground colors, change the <b>Font</b> used for labels, and even change the order of the shape within the diagram.</p>
<p>Most drawing tools available provides similar items available in the <b>Context Menu</b>. The drawing options include tools that allow you to <i>Zoom in</i> or <i>Zoom out</i> on the current diagram, and a <i>Filters</i> entry to apply filters to the objects in the diagram (or the diagram itself) to control what is visible. In the current implementation, for example, the <b>Diagram</b> Context Menu has an entry to toggle the visibility of the <i>Connector Labels</i> in the diagram, in effect turning the labels on the <b>Relationships</b> between the <b>Artifacts</b> in the diagram ON or OFF.  Under <b>File</b> in the Context Menu, there is a tool that allows you to save your current diagram as an image file, providing you with the ability to include the diagram in external system documentation.  The Context menu for <b>Tigerstripe Artifacts</b> allows you to control the visibility of the compartments in the <b>Artifact</b>, providing you the ability to hide as much detail as you like when you are preparing your documentation for distribution,  without changing the underlying diagram model.  The Context Menus for <b>Shapes</b>, <b>Artifacts</b>, <b>Relationships</b>, and <b>Features</b> in the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b> are all extensible. </p>

<h2>Referenced Objects</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is an option in any <b>Tigerstripe</b> project that allows you to <b>Publish</b> the contents of a project as a <b>Module</b>. In <b>Tigerstripe</b>, a module is represented by a <b>J</b>ava <b>AR</b>chive, or <b>JAR</b> file that contains the model defined in that project. Once your create this <b>JAR</b> file, it can be added to other <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b> as a <b>Dependency</b>. This allows for re-use of models.</p>
<p>When a published <b>Tigerstripe</b> module from one project is added as a <b>Dependency</b> in another project the <b>Artifacts</b> and <b>Relationships</b> from the first project's module become available to the <b>Dependent Project</b> however, these relationships are read-only.  Artifacts and relationships cannot be changed from the second project's perspective.  This carries over into the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b>.  When artifacts and relationships from the first project (which is a <b>JAR</b> file that is visible in the <b>Tigerstripe Explorer</b> for the second project) are copied into the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b> from the module in the <b>Tigerstripe Explorer</b>, they will be <i>read-only</i> and will prevent many actions that would be possible on those objects if they were artifacts in the second project.  In this instance, you will not be able to rename <b>Artifacts</b>, nor will you be able to add or remove <b>Features</b> from them in the second project. If the <b>Artifacts</b> in question are related to other artifacts, you will not be able to change those <b>Relationships</b>.  You will also not be able to use <b>Artifacts</b> from the module as a <i>Source</i> for any <b>Relationships</b> in the second project. Some dependencies and relationships are allowed from artifacts in the second project to artifacts in the first project (for example, an artifact in the second project can extend an artifact of the same type on the first project, for example). However, many relationships that would be possible if both artifacts were defined in  the second project will not be possible when one of the artifacts is defined as a part of a module in the first project.</p>
<p>When you are working with a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> that has dependencies on another project, just remember that there are going to be some differences in how tools like the <b>Class Diagram Editor</b> (or the multi-page editors) will behave with some objects in the <i>Dependent Project</i>.</p>
