<title>UML Support in Tigerstripe</title>
</head >
<h1>UML Support in Tigerstripe</h1>
<p><b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> provides a modeling environment specially intended for Service Contract modeling. It builds on UML by defining Service Contract specific stereotypes represented by each individual Artifact type. However, Tigerstripe is not intended to be yet another UML modeling environment, but provides integration with UML, allowing to leverage any existing UML modeling environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Integration with Eclipse plugins for UML</strong>: because Tigerstripe uses an internal representation based on Java and XML, any artifact can be dragged on to a UML diagram for most existing UML Plugins into Eclipse. For more information, please contact our <a href="../../support.html">support</a> group. </li>
  <li><a href="xmiImport/index.html"><strong>Import of existing UML Information Models into Tigerstripe projects</strong></a>: through XMI, Tigerstripe allows to import an existing UML Information model into a Tigerstripe project. </li>
</ul>
