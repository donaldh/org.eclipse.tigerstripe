<h1>Tigerstripe Workbench Customization</h1>
<p>Beyond the detailed options to control the generated code produced by <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> on a <b>Service Contract</b> model, several customization options are available to further control the output of your <b>Tigerstripe</b> project.</p>
<p>In particular, there are two areas of possible customization:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="generatedCodeCustomization.html">Customization of the Generated Integration Profiles</a>: allows for changes in your generated code.</li>
  <li><a href="publishCustomization.html">Customization of the <i>Publish</i> Website</a>: allows for re-branding of websites to where your <b>Service Contract</b> is published.</li>
</ul>
