<title>Refactoring Artifacts</title>
</head >
<h1>Refactoring Artifacts</h1>
<p>Refactoring artifacts includes tasks such as moving an Artifact from one project to another, moving an artifact from a package to another, renaming artifacts, etc..</p>
<p>Usual Eclipse mechanisms for refactoring are leveraged within Tigerstripe to make all these operations intuitive. More specifically, let's review the following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#moving">Moving Artifacts</a> across Tigerstripe projects and/or packages</li>
  <li><a href="#renaming">Renaming Artifacts</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="moving"></a>Moving Artifacts</h2>
<blockquote><p>First, make sure that the <a href="../../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/index.html">Tigerstripe Perspective</a> is active. </p>
<p>In the Tigerstripe Explorer, you can drag and drop Artifacts from any location in a src package to any location in a target src directory. This will move the internal file used to store the artifact and adjust the package name as needed.</p>
<p>The same action can be obtained by a right-click on the Artifact in the Tigerstripe Explorer and selection of the <em>Refactor-&gt;Move...</em> menu entry. </p>
<p>In most cases, Tigerstripe is able to maintain references to the artifact being refactored. However, in some case this may not be possible. In this case, errors will be flagged by the Tigerstripe auditor so they can be fixed manually. </p></blockquote>
<h2><a name="renaming"></a>Renaming Artifacts</h2>
<blockquote><p>First, make sure that the <a href="../../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/index.html">Tigerstripe Perspective</a> is active. </p>
<p>Select the artifact to rename in the Tigerstripe Explorer and right-click. Select the <em>Refactor-&gt;Rename...</em> menu entry. A dialog box will open for you to fill in the new name for that artifact.</p>
<p>In most cases, Tigerstripe is able to maintain references to the artifact being refactored. However, in some case this may not be possible. In this case, errors will be flagged by the Tigerstripe auditor so they can be fixed manually.  </p></blockquote>
