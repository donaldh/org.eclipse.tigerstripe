<h1>Entity Artifact General Information</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="../../../images/entityGeneralInfoSection.gif" border="1"></p>
<p>The <b>General Information</b> section contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project</strong>: the identifier for the <b>Tigerstripe</b> project where the artifact is defined, as it appears in the <b>Tigerstripe Explorer</b> view. You cannot edit this field. For information on how to move artifacts across projects, refer to <a href="refactoringArtifacts.html"><b>Refactoring Artifacts</b></a>. 
 
  <li> <strong>Package</strong>: the name of the package where the artifact is defined. You cannot edit this field. For more information on how to move artifacts across packages, refer to <a href="refactoringArtifacts.html"><b>Refactoring Artifacts</b></a>. 
 
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the artifact. You cannot edit this field. For more information on how to rename artifacts, refer to <a href="refactoringArtifacts.html"><b>Refactoring Artifacts</b></a>. 
 
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: a textual description of the artifact. This field can include any HTML code and should document the artifact. This field is passed to the corresponding web page when you publish your  project. For more details on Artifact documentation, refer to <a href="documentingArtifacts.html"><b>Tigerstripe Model Documentation</b></a>. 
 
  <li> <strong>Extends</strong>: the fully qualified name of the super-artifact (that is, the name of the artifact being extended by the current artifact). This is how inheritance is achieved between artifacts. For more information about inheritance within <b>Tigerstripe</b> models, refer to <a href="extendingArtifacts.html"><b>Artifact Inheritance</b></a>. </li>
</ul>
