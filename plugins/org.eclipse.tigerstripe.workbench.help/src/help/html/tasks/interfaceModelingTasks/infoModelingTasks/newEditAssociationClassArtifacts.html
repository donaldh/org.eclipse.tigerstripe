<h1>Creating and Editing Association Class Artifacts</h1>
<p>As with any Tigerstripe Artifact, <a href="../../../concepts/ossjspecificartifacts/associationclassartifact.html">Association Class Artifacts</a> can be created through a specific wizard and further edited with a form-based editor. This section covers all details and options available on Association Class Artifacts. </p>
<h2>New Association Class Wizard</h2>
<blockquote><p>First, please make sure the <a href="../../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/index.html">Tigerstripe Perspective</a> is active. </p>
<p>The <em>New Association Class Artifact</em> wizard allows the creation of new Association Class Artifacts within a Tigerstripe Project. The wizard can be open from either the <img src="../../../images/icons/new_associationClass.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle"> button from the drop down Tigerstripe icon in the toolbar or from the <em>Tigerstripe-&gt;New-&gt;Association Class </em>entry in the top menubar. The following dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"><img src="../../../images/associationClassWizard.gif" width="378" height="432"></p>
<p>As with any other type of Tigerstripe Artifact wizard, the <em>New Association Class Artifact</em> wizard requires a set of parameters before the Association Class artifact can be successfully created.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Source Project</strong>: the source project in which the association class artifact shall be created. In most cases, Tigerstripe is able to pre-populate this field based on the context. If not populated, or if the wrong project was selected, the <em>Browse</em> button can be used to select the correct Tigerstripe project in which the artifact shall be created. </li>
  <li><strong>Artifact Package</strong>: each artifact is created within the scope of a package. This field shall contain a valid package name. All non-valid names will be rejected and flagged by the wizard. </li>
  <li><strong>Artifact Name</strong>: a valid name for the artifact. This name uniquely identifies the artifact within the scope of its package. All non-valid artifact names will be rejected and flagged by the wizard.</li>
  <li><strong>aEnd Type</strong>: the fully qualified name of the artifact at the starting end of this association</li>
  <li><strong>zEnd Type</strong>: the fully qualified name of the artifact at the terminating end of this association.<br></li>
</ul>
<p>Once all the required parameters are filled in, press the <em>Finish</em> button to create the corresponding Association Class artifact. Upon creation, a corresponding icon will appear in the Tigerstripe Explorer, and the main editor page will be set to the overview tab of the corresponding artifact editor. From this page, the association class artifact can be further edited and additional information can be filled in.</p>
<p><strong>Optionally, </strong> Entity attributes can be created through this wizard as well. Please note that it is always possible to add/remove/edit attributes on Entity artifacts through the editor, refer to following section for more details.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Editing an Association Class Artifact </h2>
<blockquote><p>First, please make sure the <a href="../../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/index.html">Tigerstripe Perspective</a> is active. </p>
<p>To edit an existing Association Class Artifact, simply select its corresponding entry in the <a href="../../../gettingstarted/tigerstripeperspective/tigerstripeexplorer.html">Tigerstripe Explorer</a>, and double-click to open it in an editor. Association Class Artifacts are made of the following details:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="#General">General Information</a></strong>: common to all Artifacts, the general information section covers high level information such as version, description.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#Details">Detail</a></strong>: association end details can be defined on this artifact.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#attributes">Attributes</a></strong>: artifact attributes can be defined on this artifact.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="General"></a>General Information </h3>
<blockquote><p align="center"><img src="../../../images/entityGeneralInfoSection.gif" width="373" height="99"></p>
<p>The <em>General Information</em> section contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project</strong>: the identifier of the Tigerstripe project where this artifact is defined, as it appears in the Tigerstripe Explorer view. This field cannot be edited. For information on how to move artifacts across projects in the workspace, please visit <a href="refactoringArtifacts.html">this section</a>. </li>
  <li> <strong>Package</strong>: the name of the package where the artifact is defined. This field cannot be edited. For more information on how to move artifacts across packages, please refer to <a href="refactoringArtifacts.html">this section</a>. </li>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: the name of the artifact. This field cannot be edited. For more information on how to rename artifacts, please refer to <a href="refactoringArtifacts.html">this section</a>. </li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: a textual description of the artifact. This field can include any HTML code and should document the artifact. It is passed to the corresponding webpage when a project is published to website. For more details on Artifact documentation, please refer to<a href="documentingArtifacts.html"> this section</a>. </li>
  <li> <strong>Extends</strong>: the fully qualified name of the super-artifact (ie. the name of the artifact being extended by the current artifact). This is how inheritance is achieved between artifacts. For more information about inheritance within Tigerstripe models, please refer to <a href="extendingArtifacts.html">this section</a>. </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h3><a name="Details"></a>Association End Details</h3>
<blockquote><p>To edit this association's end details, expand the <em>Details</em> section. The section looks as shown below:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"><img src="../../../images/associationEndDetails.gif" width="750" height="253"></p>
<p>Each end of the association can be further edited. In particular you will find the following details for each end:</p><p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: The name of that end<br></li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: the fully qualified name of this end of the association<br></li>
<li><strong>Aggregation</strong>: the aggregation type for this end of the association. The usual aggregation types are supported: none, shared, composite.<br></li>
<li><strong>Multiplicity</strong>: the multiplicity for this end of the association. Fixed multiplicities only are supported: 0, 0..1, 0..*, 1..*, *<br></li>
<li><strong>Changeable</strong>: whether this end of the association shall be changeable. The following types are supported: none, frozen, addOnly.<br></li>
<li><strong>isNavigable</strong>: whether this end of the association shall be navigable.<br></li>
<li><strong>isOrdered</strong>: whether this end of the association shall be ordered.<br></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h3><a name="attributes"></a>Association Class Attributes</h3>
<blockquote><p>To edit this Artifact's attributes, expand the <em>Attributes</em> section. The section looks as shown below:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"><img src="../../../images/attributesSection.gif" width="750" height="253"></p>
<p>To <em>Add</em> an attribute, press the <em>Add</em> button. A template attribute will be created for this artifact, and the detailed view for this newly created attribute will be presented.</p>
<p>To <em>Remove</em> an attribute, simply select it in the list and press the <em>Remove</em> button. A confirmation dialog for the removal of that artifact will be displayed before the attribute is removed. </p>
<p>To <em>Edit</em> an attribute, select it in the list. The detailed view for this  attribute is displayed. It contains the following information that can be edited:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attribute Name</strong>: the name of the attribute. This must be a valid identifier, ie. including no special characters or spaces. This name must be unique within the context of this artifact. </li>
  <li><strong>Attribute Type</strong>: the fully qualified name of the type for this attribute. To be valid, the type must be:
      <ul>
        <li><em>java.lang.String</em>: this denotes a String attribute. It will be mapped appropriately in the XML and WSDL integration profile to ensure no reference to Java.</li>
        <li><em>Java primitive types</em>: the type will be mapped to the corresponding type in the XML and WSDL integration profile to ensure no reference to Java.</li>
        <li><em>Valid Datatype Artifact</em> <em>type</em>,</li>
        <li><em>Valid Entity Artifact </em><em>type</em><em>.</em></li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Multiplicity</strong>: the multiplicity allows to denote the use of arrays for attributes of type String, of any primitive type, or Datatype Artifact type. When used in combination with an Entity Artifact type, please refer to <a href="definingAssociations.html">this section</a> for more information on associations within Tigerstripe Models.</li>
  <li><strong>Visibility</strong>: defines the visibility of the attribute.</li>
  <li><strong>Modifiers</strong>: there are two possible modifiers that can be applied to an Attribute:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Optional</strong>: an attribute marked as <em>optional</em> means that the implementation may chose to not implement it, but would be compliant with the service contract. </li>
        <li><strong>Readonly</strong>: an attribute marked as <em>readonly</em> denotes an attribute that can only be read by consumers of the Service Contract.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reference</strong>: when the attribute type is an Entity Artifact type, the attribute can be further specified to qualify the type of reference to the target entity type. Please refer to <a href="definingAssociations.html">this section</a> for more information on associations within Tigerstripe models. </li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: a textual description of the attribute. This field shall document the purpose of the attribute. Any HTML code can be placed in to the field as it will be propagated into the web site where the project may be published, as well as in the generated code. For more details on Artifact documentation, please refer to<a href="documentingArtifacts.html"> this section</a>. </li>
</ul></blockquote></blockquote>
