<h1>Tigerstripe Model Documentation</h1>
<p>The modeling methodology provided with <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> guides you in the design process of a <b>Service Contract</b> by ensuring implementability of the designed <b>Service Contract</b>. Although a lot of information is carried by the Artifact model, the model requires solid documentation to be meaningful for implementation teams.</p>
<h2>Documenting a Design</h2>
<blockquote><p>You can input documentation in <b>Tigerstripe</b> at various levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>At the project level</strong>: within the <b>Tigerstripe</b> descriptor, you can enter a textual description of your project. 
 
  <li><strong>At the Artifact level</strong>: for each artifact, you can enter a textual description. 
 
  <li><strong>At the Artifact element level</strong>: for every single element making up an artifact (attributes, constants, methods), you can enter a textual description.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> You can enter valid HTML code at all levels to document your <b>Service Contract</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What happens with the documentation?</h2>
<blockquote><p>Project documentation is stored in the model (within each artifact definition) so it can be leveraged during generation and publishing of your <b>Service Contract</b>.</p>
<p>When generating your <b>Service Contract</b>, the documentation associated with any element of the model is copied into the corresponding generated code. For example, for any XML element created as a result of an artifact being defined in the model, the description is copied.</p>
