<h1>Project Import/Export Tasks</h1>
<p>In a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment, <b>Service Contracts</b> can interact with each other, sharing information models and utilizing the various capabilities of other information models. To avoid duplicate and unnecessary complexity, <b>Tigerstripe</b> allows you to share entire <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects, information within <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects, and provides a way to build dependencies between your projects.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate collaboration between users working on a SOA design, <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> allows you to share projects through the following mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Copies</b>: this option is easiest way of sharing <b>Service Contract</b> models between <b>Tigerstripe</b> users however it provides very limited support for collaboration. This method relies on a copy of the content in your project. Since projects are self-contained, they can be either copied or exported to <i>.zip</i> archives and imported to another project.</li>
  <li><b>Source Control Systems</b>: this option leverages the use of a versioning control system to maintain versions of your <b>Tigerstripe</b> models. This mode of collaboration and model sharing allows you to share the actual <b>Tigerstripe</b> model, and designs them in a controlled environment. This method is most ideal when multiple architects need to work on a single <b>Tigerstripe</b> model.</li>
  <li><b>Tigerstripe Modules</b>: <b>Tigerstripe</b> modules are compiled versions of <b>Tigerstripe</b> models.  Their content can be referenced by other <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects. However, they cannot be modified. This is the preferred method of establishing dependencies between <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects that share a common information model.</li>
  <li><b>Published Web Sites</b>: <b>Tigerstripe</b> can publish <b>Service Contract</b> definitions, that is, <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects, to a web-based document. Users can either uploaded the projects to a web site or access them locally from a hard drive. This method provides a convenient way to share a <b>Service Contract</b> design to a large number of users. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="importing"></a>Importing Tigerstripe Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To learn more about how to import <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b> from a directory or a zipped archive, refer to <a href="../../interfaceModelingTasks/importTigerstripeProject.html">Importing a Tigerstripe Project</a>.</li>
  <li>To learn more about how to import <b>Tigerstripe Projects</b> from a versioning control system, refer to <a href="../../teamCollaborationTasks/scm.html">Tigerstripe Source Control Integration</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Exporting Tigerstripe Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To export a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> as a zipped archive, refer to <a href="../../interfaceModelingTasks/exportToArchiveTigerstripeProject.html">Exporting a Tigerstripe Project</a>.</li>
  <li>To export a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> to a module, refer to <a href="workingWithModules.html">Working with Tigerstripe Modules</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Working with Tigerstripe Modules</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Tigerstripe</b> Modules are <i>binary-like</i> versions of a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b>. You can reference their content to be shared between multiple projects, however they cannot be modified. This provides an ideal mechanism to share information models between <b>Service Contract</b> designs. For more information on how to create and use <b>Tigerstripe</b> modules, refer to <a href="workingWithModules.html">Working with Tigerstripe Modules</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Publishing Tigerstripe Projects</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To facilitate collaboration between team members, <b>Tigerstripe</b> allows you to publish a <b>Tigerstripe Project</b> to a web site, where the content of the corresponding <b>Service Contract</b> can be browsed and the target integration profiles can be downloaded.</p>
<p>For more information on how to publish a <b>Tigerstripe</b> project, refer to <a href="../../teamCollaborationTasks/publishInterfaces.html">Publishing Service Contracts</a>. </p>
