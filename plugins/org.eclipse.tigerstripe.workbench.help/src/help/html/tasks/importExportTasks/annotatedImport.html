<h1>Annotated Imports</h1>

<p>Several import types use the <b>Annotated Import</b> behavior described in this section.<p>

<p>The <b>Model Annotation</b> page of the <b>Import</b>wizard highlights objects that the <b>Import</b> tool found in the import source, and has determined are suitable candidates for import as <b>Artifacts</b>. The <b>Artifact</b> type may or may not be possible to determine depending on the amount of information found in the import source. When it is possible to determine an <b>Artifact</b> type, the potential artifact is displayed with the icon for that <b>Artifact</b> type.
When it not possible to determine an <b>Artifact</b> type, the potential artifact is displayed with a question-mark (?) icon.</p>

<p>You can update the <i>determined</i> and <i>undetermined</i> artifacts to an <b>Artifact</b> type by right-clicking on the artifact and selecting the target type from the list of artifacts presented.</p> <p><b>Note:</b>  Some choices could result in the loss of information if the target artifact does not support all of the information found in the source. For example, <b>Enumeration</b> artifacts do not support methods. You can elect to <i>ignore</i> this potential artifact by selecting <b>ignore</b> from the list.</p>

<h2>Referencing a Project</h2>
<blockquote><p>Using this option, an import will use the <i>Referenced project</i> to minimize user intervention and to identify deltas. The <b>Reference Project</b> should be a project into which a previous import has been performed. If an artifact has previously been created using the import, then the <b>Import</b> wizard will use the same artifact type. Similarly, only deltas between the reference and new import are applied to the target project.</p>

<p>You can limit the <b>Model Annotation</b> page to show the deltas between the referenced project and the information found in the import source. This is accomplished by selecting <b>Show delta only</b> on the dialog box. This will simplify the display when reviewing changes in a complex model.</p></blockquote>
