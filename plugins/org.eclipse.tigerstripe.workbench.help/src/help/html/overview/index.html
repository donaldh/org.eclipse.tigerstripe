<h1>Introducing Tigerstripe Workbench&trade;</h1>
<p class="style2">Tigerstripe Workbench is the first interface modeling tool to create open, standards-based application interfaces for integrating enterprise systems in telecommunications companies. </p>
<p>Working within a wizard-based graphical environment, users simply click through interface modeling screens to specify interfaces for linking proprietary systems. While users focus on system-level engineering requirements, Workbench automatically applies patterns, guidelines, and best practices to generate standards-based APIs. With little or no need for coding experience, users can create detailed specifications for consistent, complex APIs in very little time.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ready for use by telecommunications service providers, equipment vendors, and system integrators</li>
  <li> Integrates enterprise systems within an open, service-oriented architecture running Web Services</li>
  <li> Generates interface specifications in WSDL, JMS/XML, and J2EE formats</li>
  <li> Automatically complies with industry-approved standards, including New Generation Operations Systems and Software (NGOSS), OSS through JAVA (OSS/J), and Shared Information and Data Model (SID)</li>
  <li> Works with the leading middleware and business process modeling tools</li>
  <li> Runs within the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE)</li>
  <li> Quickly incorporates custom business rules in any interface or interface extension<br>
  </li>
</ul>
