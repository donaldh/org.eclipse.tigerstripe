<h1>Artifact Editors</h1>
<p>When editing the details of any artifact within a Tigerstripe project, a form-based editor is provided. For any artifact, this editor can be brought up by either double-clicking on the corresponding artifact in the Tigerstripe Explorer, or by right-clicking on the target artifact in the Tigerstripe Explorer and selecting <em>Open</em>.</p>
<p>The main page of any Artifact editor looks as follows:</p>
<p align="center" class="style2"><img src="../basictutorial/firstproject/images/DatatypeInEnum.gif" width="700" height="438"></p>
<p>All artifact editors follow the same structure, a 3-tab editor with the following content: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Overview Tab</strong>: the overview tab contains the core information about all artifacts. In fact, they all share a common set of information, such as a name, a package, a description, etc... that will be found on this tab.</li>
  <li><strong>OSSJ Tab</strong>: the OSS/J Tab provides a way to give the Tigerstripe generator additional information and hints on the elements to generate.</li>
  <li><strong>Source Tab</strong>: the source tab provides a direct view in the source file in its internal Tigerstripe representation. This tab should only be reserved to expert users when needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tab is made out of <em>Sections</em>. For example the main tab as shown above is made out of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>General Information:</strong> this section contains the general information about this artifact. This section appears on every artifact editor, as it corresponds to the common set of information required by all artifacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Details</strong>: this section provides a high-level explanation of the content to be specified for a target artifact.</li>
  <li><strong>Methods, Attributes, Constants:</strong> depending on the target artifact being editing these section will (or will not) be present. Each of them can expanded to create/edit/delete the corresponding artifacte elements (methods, attributes and constants).</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the specific editors, please visit the corresponding section as they appear on <a href="../../tasks/interfaceModelingTasks/infoModelingTasks/index.html">this section</a>.</p>
