<title>Tigerstripe Workbench Perspective</title>
</head >
<h1>Tigerstripe Workbench Perspective</h1>
<p>In Eclipse, a perspective defines the initial set and layout of project views in the workbench window. Typically, plug-ins to Eclipse contribute their own perspective to group and organize functionalities of the product.</p>
<p><b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> however, contributes a specific <b>Tigerstripe</b> perspective, capturing the actions, views, and layout required to accomplish all the tasks related to designing, documenting, and generating <b>Service Contracts</b>. Through this perspective, you can create, edit, and publish <b>Service Contracts</b> using <b>Tigerstripe</b>.</p>
<h3>To open a Tigerstripe perspective:</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Open Eclipse.</li>
   <li>Click <b>Window</b> and select <b>Open Perspective</b></li>
   <li>Click <b>Tigerstripe</b>. The <b>Tigerstripe</b> perspective opens.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <b>Tigerstripe</b> perspective contains the usual components of an Eclipse perspective, including the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The<a href="tigerstripeexplorer.html"> Tigerstripe Explorer</a>, which presents an outline of all the artifacts, files, and descriptors contained within a <b>Tigerstripe</b> project.</li>
  <li>A set of <a href="artifacteditors.html">Form-based Editors</a>, which allow you to specify all the details of any <b>Tigerstripe</b> artifact included in a project.</li>
  <li>A <a href="projectauditor.htm">Project Auditor</a>, that continuously audits all open <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects in the workspace for errors. Errors are signaled in the usual <b>Problem</b> view of Eclipse.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center" class="style2"><img src="images/ts-perspective.gif" width="750" height="469"></p>
<p>The <b>Tigerstripe</b> perspective is associated with <b>Tigerstripe</b> projects and is automatically started whenever you open a <b>Tigerstripe</b> project. However, you can open the <b>Tigerstripe</b> perspective at anytime by completing the following steps:
<ol>
   <li>Click <b>Window</b> and select <b>Open Perspective</b>.</li>
   <li>Click <b>Tigerstripe</b>. </li>
   </ol>
   <p>This will restore your current Eclipse layout for the <b>Tigerstripe</b> perspective.</p>
