<h1>Getting Started with Tigerstripe Workbench</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote><p>In the context of Enterprise Architecture, the choice of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged over the past few years as a flexible solution to align business needs with IT decisions. At the core of SOA, the IT infrastructure is presented through a set of services that are often composed to fulfill business processes. Each of these services are specified through <b>Service Contracts</b> that capture the capabilities offered by these services from a business perspective.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of deploying a successful Enterprise Architecture, is to properly identify and design the services that will be deployed on top of IT applications and systems. The telecommunication industry has developed a set of standards through bodies such as the TeleManagement Forum or the OSS through Java&trade; initiative that provides design guidelines, best practices, and patterns to ensure that the final solution is successful.</p>
<p><b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> encapsulates these design guidelines and best practices in a Workbench integrated with Eclipse, where an OSS/BSS Architect can model, design, and release standard compliant <b>Service Contracts</b>. </p>
<p>This first section is intended to guide you through your first Tigerstripe project, where you will design a simple <b>Service Contract</b>. The basic concepts behind <b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> are introduced so you can easily navigate the <b>Workbench Perspective</b>.</p>
<p>The following concepts will be covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="tigerstripeperspective/index.html">Tigerstripe Perspective</a> is introduced to present the workbench used to perform all <b>Tigerstripe</b> related tasks.</li>
  <li>The &quot;<a href="basictutorial/index.html">Basic Tutorial</a>&quot; is a tutorial that will guide you through your first <b>Tigerstripe Project</b>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>Tigerstripe Workbench Architecture</h2>
<blockquote><p>Tigerstripe Workbench is composed of three major components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Core Engine</strong> which transforms the model of a <b>Service Contract</b> into an internal representation that can be used to generate such information as <b>Service Contract</b> specifications, documentation, and implementation.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Eclipse Plug-in</strong>, which provides a graphical user interface to design, test and release <b>Service Contracts</b>.</li>
  <li> A set of <strong>Tigerstripe Generators</strong> that capture the specifics of each standard and produces the corresponding development code (i.e. XML Integration Profile for OSS/J).</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2>Eclipse Integration</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>Tigerstripe Workbench</b> is fully integrated with Eclipse and adheres to the Eclipse guidelines. As a result, an Eclipse user will quickly become acquainted with Tigerstripe. </p></blockquote>
